// Example 6 - String methods and chaining
// Write a script that calculates a person's body mass index. For this you need to divide the weight in kilograms by the square of the person's height in meters.

// Weight and height are stored in the weight and height variables, but not as numbers, but in as strings (specially for the task). Non-integer numbers can be given as 24.7 or 24,7,that is, as a separator of the fractional part can be comma.

// The body mass index should be rounded to one decimal place;

let weight = '88,3';
let height = '1.75';

// const bmi = ;
console.log(bmi); // 28.8
